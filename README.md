This project was done mainly with Tailwind CSS and Svelte. There was ESLint + prettier here but we did not implement due to proving not everything is in AI. 

The project key contributors are:  
 **John** (Svelte + SvelteKit + Tailwind + MongoDB)

**Key takeaways - AI**
* Don’t believe the rumors that AI will takeover web developers. It won’t! Don’t believe? Download Python and check the AI builders
* GBT still giving me Svelte 4 logic when we are in Svelte 5, most logics cannot rely on GBT. BE is even more impossible, too many files and errors have to be manually found. 

**Patreons**
* Rich Haaris (Bro did his very best in making our generation easier in web dev)
* Jamie (I took her code and implemented in my BE, without her I wouldn't know how to push everything to my Sveltekit)
* Myself (Took the initiative to learn SvelteKit)

**Final take**
* Don’t be afraid to try new things, if you don’t agree with something, try another thing. Keep trying until you find what is the best UX
* If the current environment affects your coding journey, move somewhere greener. Touch grass.
* Don't be scared, trust yourself when pushing things to a brand new source
